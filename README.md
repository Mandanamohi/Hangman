This Python script generates a random word from a predefined list and allows the user to input a single letter, providing feedback on whether the input is valid or not.
The aim of the project is to demonstrate the use of the random module, taking user input, and implementing basic input validation.
What I learned:
- Use of the `random` module in Python.
- Taking user input with the `input()` function.
- Implementing basic input validation.
